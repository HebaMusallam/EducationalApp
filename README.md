I am develop a simple educational Android application that uses Sharedprefernces to store user preferences. 
The application should present educational content and allow the user to select the application language and text size (Small, Medium, or Large). 
These preferences must be saved locally using SharedPreferences and automatically retrieved when the application is restarted.
The purpose of this application is to demonstrate how persistent user settings can be used in educational applications to improve usability and support personalized learning experiences.
